     * @param instr The instruction that is to be interpreted. It is the responsibility of implementations to make sure

     * @param defSite The definition site that corresponds to the given instruction. `defSite` is
     *                not necessary for processing `instr`, however, may be used, e.g., for
     *                housekeeping purposes. Thus, concrete implementations should indicate whether
     *                this value is of importance for (further) processing.
     * @return The interpreted instruction. A neutral StringConstancyProperty contained in the
     *         result indicates that an instruction was not / could not be interpreted (e.g.,
     *         because it is not supported or it was processed before).
     *         <p>
     *         As demanded by [[org.opalj.tac.fpcf.analyses.string_analysis.interpretation.InterpretationHandler]], the
     *         entity of the result should be the definition site. However, as interpreters know the instruction to
     *         interpret but not the definition site, this function returns the interpreted instruction as entity.
     *         Thus, the entity needs to be replaced by the calling client.
