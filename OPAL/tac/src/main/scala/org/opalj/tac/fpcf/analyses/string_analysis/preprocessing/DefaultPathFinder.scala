/**
 * An approach based on an intuitive traversing of the control flow graph (CFG). This implementation
 * will use the CFG to find all paths from the very first statement of the CFG to all end / leaf
 * statements in the CFG, ignoring `startSites` and `endSite` passed to
 * [[DefaultPathFinder#findPaths]].
 *
 * @author Maximilian RÃ¼sch
 *
 * @note To fill gaps, e.g., from the very first statement of a context, such as a CFG, to the first
 *       control structure, a consecutive row of path elements are inserted. Arbitrarily inserted
 *       jumps within the bytecode might lead to a different order than the one computed by this
 *       class!
